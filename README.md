# Python Programs for Grinstead and Snell Exercises
This repository is supposed to provide the python programs for Grinstead and Snell exercises. As their exercises are written in Mathematica, I aim to write python code for all the exercises.

I started this work on the 28th of July 2018 as I have a keen interest in python as well as probability and realized there is no repository which contains all the programs as such in python.

# Structure

This repository would be divided into multiple directories divided for each lesson and each lesson would be further grouped into sets. If there are 30 exercises given as a group at in Lesson 1, they would be classified under Set 1.
The next group of exercises would be classified under Set 2.

There are no ordering to examples. I have coded a few of the interesting ones and have stuck to the same numbering as given in  the book.
