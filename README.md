# Python Programs for Grinstead and Snell Exercises
This repository is supposed to provide the python programs for Grinstead and Snell exercises. As their exercises are written in Mathematica, I aim to write python code for all the exercises.

I started this work on the 28th of July 2018 as I have a keen interest in python as well as probability and realized there is no repository which contains all the programs as such in python.
